.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to get info about and modify Apple trustcaches.
.Pp
The following commands are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width create
.It Xo
.Cm append
.Op Fl u Ar uuid | 0
.Ar infile
.Ar
.Xc
Modify the trustcache at
.Ar infile
to include each signed Mach-O in the specified path.
.Ar uuid
is used to specify a custom uuid to be used.
If it is
.Ar 0 ,
the uuid will be left the same, otherwise, it will be regenerated.
.It Xo
.Cm create
.Op Fl u Ar uuid
.Op Fl v Ar version
.Ar outfile
.Ar
.Xc
Create a trustcache at
.Ar outfile .
Each Mach-O found in the specified inputs will be scanned for
a code signature and hashed.
Any malformed or unsigned Mach-O will be ignored.
Each slice of a FAT binary will have its hash included.
Versions 0 and 1 are supported, if not specified, 1 is assumed.
If
.Ar uuid
is specified, that will be used instead of a randomly generated one.
.It Xo
.Cm info
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl e Ar entrynum
.Ar file
.Xc
Print information about
.Ar file .
The output for each hash will be in the format:
.Pp
.Dl <cdhash> <flags> [<hash_type>]
.Pp
If the
.Fl c
is given, only the hashes will be printed.
If
.Fl h
is given, only the header will be printed.
If
.Ar entrynum
is specified, only that entry will be printed.
